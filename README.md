# IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition and Performance Analysis

## Introduction

Employee attrition is one of the most pressing challenges in Human Resource Management. Understanding the key drivers behind attrition can help organizations create better work environments, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover. This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics dataset to uncover insights into employee attrition and performance across various dimensions such as age, gender, department, job role, marital status, and more.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze factors contributing to employee attrition and performance. The analysis identifies patterns and trends across different employee groups, helping HR professionals understand which attributes are associated with higher resignation rates.

## Data Source

- *Dataset Name*: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
- *Source*: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- *Size*: 1,470 employee records

## Tools and Technique

- *Power BI*: Used for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation
- *SQL*: Used for data Qureying and analysis
- *Microsoft Excel*: Used for data preprocessing and transformation  

##  Data Processing and Cleaning

- Removed redundant columns such as EmployeeCount and Over18  
- Converted categorical variables into usable formats  
- Handled missing values
- Verified data types and corrected inconsistencies

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from the dashboard include:

- *Overall Attrition Rate*: 16.1% (237 out of 1470 employees)
- *By Marital Status*: Singles are more likely to leave compared to married or divorced employees
- *By Overtime*: 30.5% of employees who worked overtime left, compared to only 10.4% who didnâ€™t
- *By Age Group*: Employees aged 30â€“39 had the highest attrition rate
- *By Gender*: Females had a slightly higher attrition rate (17.6%) than males (14.6%)
- *By Job Role*: Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians saw the most attrition
- *By Department*: Sales had the highest attrition cases, followed by Research & Development
- *By Business Travel*: Frequent travelers were more likely to leave


## Performance Comparison

While performance ratings in the dataset showed minimal variation (most employees were rated similarly), cross-analysis revealed:
- High-performing employees still left at notable rates, especially in roles with frequent overtime or low job satisfaction
- Employees in customer-facing or sales roles exhibited higher attrition despite average performance


##  Recommendations

Based on the findings:

- *Reduce Overtime*: Implement better workload balancing to reduce burnout
- *Focus on Young Talent*: Provide growth paths and mentorship for employees aged 30â€“39
- *Improve Job Satisfaction*: Especially in sales and technical roles
- *Targeted Retention Programs*: For single and female employees who showed slightly higher attrition rates
- *Reassess Travel Policies*: As frequent business travel may increase turnover


##  Limitations

- The dataset is synthetic and anonymized, which limits real-world context  
- No direct performance improvement indicators (e.g., promotion history, peer reviews)  
- Categorical bias may exist due to class imbalance in departments or roles  
- Data is not time-based, so trends over time could not be analyzed
